This post extends the [discussion](https://blog.zuberek.net/2023-07-24/defectivity-in-polish-verbs) on morphological defectivity in Polish by including verbs.  To that end, it follows the taxonomy proposed by Dyszak (2001)<sup>1</sup> and implemented in the the previous post.  Taking into account the understaning of defectivity as a morphological phenomenon whereby the grammar is unable to generate certain inflectional forms, the landscape of Polish nominal defectivity can be expressed in terms of two main categories: nouns that are formally defective, and nouns that are defective both formally and functionally.  A more granular representation of this classification is presented below:

- Formally defective nouns
    - Nouns that lack morphological case distinction in the singular but not in the plural forms: 'muzeum', 'faksymile', etc.
    - Nouns that lack morphological case distinction both in the singular and the plural: 'escudo', 'peso'
    - Nouns that don't decline by case or inflect by the grammatical number: 'atelier'
    - Nouns that exist and decline only in plural: 'sanie' (sleigh), 'chrzciny' (christiening), nożyczki (scissors), etc.
    - Nouns that exist only in the singular:
        - Nouns that decline by cases: 'sanna' (a road covered in snow)
        - Nouns that don't decline by cases: 'forum', 'profesor' *fem.*, 'pekao' (bank PKO)

- Formally and functionally defective nouns
    - *singularia tantum*
        - declinable by case: 'złość' (anger), 'chuliganeria' (hooliganism), etc.
        - non-declinable by case: 'tabu', 'kworum' (quorum)
    - Nouns existing only in the singular: 'stryjostwo' (uncles)
    - *pluralia tantum*
        - non-countable nouns such as: 'fusy' (dregs), 'rodzice' (parents)
    - Nouns existing only in the plural: 'rodzice' (parents)
