### zub.buz

This is my personal blog developed in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator written in Ruby.  The site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The blog uses [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale), a minimal Jekyll theme curated for storytellers, and modified to extend the styling of [zuberek.net](www.zuberek.net).  The commenting is implemented with [giscus](https://giscus.app), a comments system powered by GitHub Discussions.  A GitHub account is required to post comments.
